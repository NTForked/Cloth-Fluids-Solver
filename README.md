Cloth/Fluids Solver
================

This program is equipped with basic Disney magic for cloth simulation and fluid interactions. The implementations are based off of the following:

* Cloth: Stretching, Hinge Bending potentials with penalty-force collisions on signed distance fields
* Fluids: [Stable Fluids](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pdf/ns.pdf) by Jos Stam
